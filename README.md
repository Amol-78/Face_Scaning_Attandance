# Face_Scaning_Attandance

Face Recognition Attendance System (with Auto-Update & Cooldown)

Taking attendance manually is repetitive and time-consuming.
To automate this, I developed a Face Recognition Attendance Application that uses computer vision and real-time recognition to log attendance instantly.

âœ¨ What it Does:

Detects and recognizes faces in real time via webcam.

Marks attendance (Name, Date, Time) directly into a CSV file.

Applies a cooldown mechanism (avoids multiple entries within 1 minute).

Allows saving new faces live during runtime â€” no restart needed.

Uses color-coded boxes for feedback:
ðŸŸ© Green â†’ Recognized & marked
ðŸŸ¨ Yellow â†’ Within cooldown
ðŸŸ¥ Red â†’ Unknown face

ðŸ’¡ Project Highlights:
âœ… Real-time face detection & recognition
âœ… Automated CSV attendance logging
âœ… Cooldown logic to prevent duplicate entries
âœ… Dynamic face addition without retraining
âœ… Clear visual feedback with OpenCV
âœ… Beginner-friendly & scalable for institutions

ðŸ§  Built With: Python | OpenCV | Face Recognition Library | Pandas
